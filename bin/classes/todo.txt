- Maybe make UI elements use a physical size (not density based pixels)
- Move game over to its own screen (but keep paused with game screen)
- Make main menu
- Achievements + sounds using a world listener object - when something happens in the world, the relevant function in the listener gets called
- Play around with game difficulty, work out how its going to work (increasing, fixed etc)
- Think about different game modes (timed, reach X points, different board sizes etc)
