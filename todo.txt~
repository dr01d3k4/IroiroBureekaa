- Change game world to use a pool for falling pieces and cells
- Maybe make UI elements use a physical size (not density based pixels)
- Make main menu look better and complete all the buttons
- Achievements + sounds using a world listener object - when something happens in the world, the relevant function in the listener gets called
- Look into google play games
- Play around with game difficulty, work out how its going to work (increasing, fixed etc)
- Think about different game modes (timed, reach X points, different board sizes etc)
